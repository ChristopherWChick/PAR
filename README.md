PURPOSE
	The overall goal of Plant Acceleration Research (PAR) is to interface plants with technology to deliver efficient and effective natural conservation solutions. Experiments use a collective grouping of diodes. These diodes are mounted to a single Raspberry Pi system equipped with an Industrial Automation HAT. Environmental sensors, monitors and cameras are attached to a Raspberry Pi system for management. Collectively, the housing, components, functions, systems, and processes makeup the autonomous Acceleration Chamber environment.
	The function of autonomy implements several controls including mechanical, logical, and physical controls that provide system regulation, function control, data collection and backup. Backups are transmitted to the cloud and physical storage device the system is equipped with an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) in the event of power loss. Python and C are two of the languages that power this operation and enable the experiments in their current form to be conducted.
	The long-term goals include scalable applications of plant phototherapy systems for applications in ecosystems, farms, and urban agriculture via drones and other remote application. This is achievable through market modification of an existing drone, or a completely unique drone model designed exclusively for phototherapy delivery. Currently, the goal is to inspect, observe and analyze data in a controlled and sequestered environment to establish a “best practice” and reliably contribute to standard operating procedures. Once this is achieved, the technology could be refined, consolidated, and prepared for field application, with improved code and photo efficiency.

FUNCTIONS
	As previously stated, there are environmental control systems connected to Raspberry Pi. Those components include temperature, humidity and pH, a digital clock and (a) wireless camera(s). Autonomous controls command system functions, regulation, duration and frequency of photon deployment, data collection and backup. The system is assembled with careful planning and a degree of forethought to accommodate future implementations relating to overall research goals. 
ROLES
	Admin - Unrestricted access to primary and secondary systems, script modification, remote-control, viewing and schedule modification. Responsible for management and maintenance of systems, including the physical research environment, analysis, and dissemination of data. Full knowledge of all system components including hardware, software, system functions and process. Can build Acceleration Chambers and Constellation Phototherapy Systems. Plant Acceleration Expert.

	Partner - Remote-camera view-only access and context specific controls, knowledge of some systems and components. 

	Public - View Only - Schedule launch May 4, 2023.
